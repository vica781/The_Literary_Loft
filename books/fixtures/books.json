The picture examples serves as good examples both for techniques illustrated, but also as inspiration for finding motives that will work in b&amp;w, and for seeing motives in general.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The main reason I like this book is that it covers many aspects of mono tone photography in quite a brief but still a fairly thorough way. It doesn't go into tens of pages of waffle for each sub section like some books just to boost the page count and therefore the price. I've been into photography for 15 years and I still managed to pick up a few things I didn't know.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I thought the way in which he introduces the concept of mono tone imagery and then brings us into the digital age is very well done.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">He offers up some pretty useful digital editing techniques which I haven't seen.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">All in all this book didn't blow me away but I'm very glad to own it. The images in the book range from ok(ish) to good but for me that's not so important. He manages to pass on the important info.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I would recommend this product to any low to mid level photographer.</span>'</p>"},

Its not just about technical stuff, it also touches on being tuition in art, and it feels a little philosophical in places too. I think the photos are the finest I have seen to date.

It's printed on thick glossy paper and the colour reproduction is excellent.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The information contained in this book is very in depth and it starts from the basics, and advances to the more intermediate level as you get further into the book.

It really is a complete guide to photography. A beginner could pick this up, read it, and come away with a complete understanding of the basics of photography.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">This book helps you take your photos from basic snapshots to professional looking print quality photos.

Back then we used to use the 35mm film camera's and so I had the basic concepts down but needed a refresher. I recently inherited a Canon EOS 400D with a great zoom lens and I wanted to make sure that I use it to it's full capabilities. The way the chapters and sections are divided is great because you can refer to the section you are most interested in rather than read it from cover to cover (as I hardly read manuals like that I prefer books that treat each subject individually as a stand alone). The book serves to show you what constitutes a photograph and explains the basic concepts. It also shows you (where it is relevant!) a photo with a setting and a photo without, so you can actually see what each setting refers to. The section on composition and lighting is actually more to do with training you to get a photographer's eye and then shows you how to achieve it with the filters and settings that they recommend. Overall a good book for the beginner and seasoned veteran, if only to sit on your shelf for that one day when you just can't remember what something means on your camera.</span>'</p>"},

Escaping life’s everyday tasks, I enjoy imagining trying out projects, visualizing tying motions, or designing shapes and combining patterns together in my mind. I’ve always taken comfort from thinking in this way, and I’ve had some of my best ideas when driving to the supermarket! This book is right for you if, like me, you enjoy focusing on making, have a curiosity to understand how macramé art is made, and a hope to design beautiful things yourself.<br>When did my own obsession with macramé begin? As a ten-year-old, I first discovered knotting when practising the ‘art’ of creative shoelace tying for customized roller skates and trainers. As a teenager, I explored further by braiding and knotting my hair, which created some interesting looks, much to my family’s surprise. But it was as a student at university, wanting to put my own stamp on my first-ever rented property, that I really began to explore macramé, initially decorating with plant hangers and smaller macramé motifs, then gaining confidence to make larger wall hangings and tapestries. Now, nearly a decade later, I have macramé to thank for so many things! My pastime and hobby has transformed into an online craft business that has allowed me to reach so many people across the globe through the power of the internet, social media and in-person workshops too.<br>I know from my own experiences that learning the craft of macramé can take you on a fulfilling and creative journey of self-expression.

It has 3 levels of difficulty. Level one uses only one colour for each part, super simple. Level two usually adds a simple colour change (legs change colour after feet) and level three has multiple colour changes to make face details etc. The hints and tips have good photographed instructions for the stitches needed and I had no problems following the patterns. I did find on the toft YouTube channel, videos to show sewing up, stitches etc which are useful if you have not made soft toys before.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I have made level one bunny, elephant and rhino and level two monkey and pony.

However there are still a lots of different designs to choose from, at least 30 different animals which is a lot of choice.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A great book would thoroughly recommend</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">These are really classy yet child friendly designs with easy to follow instructions, and I loved the little ‘back story’ that each animal has! Also, I like how you get 4 size options - I’ve made several so far in 2 different sizes and they all came out great! The only problem I had was that although there are a lot of helpful tips and explanations of how to do the trickier techniques, there are times when you just to SEE it; whether in a diagram or a video tutorial. Written instructions just aren’t enough sometimes, but TOFT do have some online videos that explain how to do some of the details like fur/hair/spikes/etc.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">What I like about this book is that with a few simple techniques, which are fully explained at the beginning of the book, you can create increasingly difficult animals for someone to love. It's left up to you what yarn thickness you'll use, and thereby how big your animal will be. You use the appropriate hook size for the yarn, which should be on the ball band (same as needle size). You can easily make whole families if you wish. Each \"pattern\" comes with a background story of the animal which will have you smiling if not laughing out loud. This is definitely one of those books that you will not be leaving on the coffee table or bookshelf.</span>'</p>"},

I like to practice drawing as much as possible, so I draw free hand.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">However, this is a lovely book there are many pages of animals.

However, for me the book has some serious let-downs. 1 - the inclusion of several white or black and white species - two pictures of swans, a badger, a seagull and what appears to be a blackbird - interesting for the sketch artist but not for the colourist. 2 - a lot of the pictures seem unfinished, or have random \"impressions\" of things in the background - again, fine for the sketch artist but downright frustrating for the colourist. 3 - there is no indication of what each species actually is, which unless you want to go impressionist is awkward - you have to try and guess. For the animal pictures thats not too big a deal, but for the birds I find it a serious drawback. I shall colour the pictures I like and can identify, and use the rest as shading or background practice; for these reasons I wont be buying more from this artist.</span>'</p>"},

Based on exclusive interviews with passengers and crew, CABIN FEVER, chronicles the heroics as beleaguered crew members fight to survive as port after port refuses to receive what is known as \"The Pariah Ship.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Earlier books include 438 Days - a tale of survival at sea that Outside magazine called \"the best survival book in a decade.\" I spent months interviewing fisherman Salvador Alvarenga and diving deep into the world of extreme survival. At first, it seemed impossible. How could a fisheman adrift in a tiny boat live 14 months at sea? Only Hollywood could have an ending like this where a single man drifts 6,000 miles and survives on his wits, humor, and resourcefulness. But it's true, Alvarenga lived for over a year in his tiny fishing boat, adrift in the Pacific. This is a daring, bold tale that highlights the simple pleasures in life. Like a glass of water. A square of chocolate. A smile. Maybe life isn't so complicated?</p>","review":"<p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Beautifully written, well researched, and easy to read. An astonishing tale. How did he survive all that time at sea....in the Pacific? Only a superman with extraordinary reserves of positiveness, and a determination to survive at any cost got him through. Highly recommend this amazing book.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Amazing story and appears to be very accurate.

Well researched and well written. Thought provoking, humbling, disturbing yet inspirational. The stark reality of life adrift in an expanse of eternal water, fighting to stay alive day and night, week after week, month after month, when hope has gone, is described without unnecessary embellishment or sentimentality. The author did a very good job. A book I will always remember.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A really well written book. I don't usually read this sort of thing but was intrigued as to how anyone can survive so long at sea alone. It takes you from how he became a fisherman, to the terrible times and all the events that happen at sea. Incredible that men on a container ship just waved at him 2,000 miles out at sea. I wondered how these men felt when the story broke. Salvador was tenacious, resourceful and never gave up, such strength. I hope his life is happy.</span>'</p>"},

Things did not go according to plan in Joe's first years as a police dog handler - he just couldn't find the right dog. Then Cass came along. The two of them quickly formed a bond, graduated as stars from their training, and became an outstanding, effective working partnership. Car thieves, armed robbers, drug dealers, burglars - Cassius learned how to track them down, contain them, intimidate them ...and, if needs be, attack them too. It was a dangerous life for both him and Joe. But Cass was still a dog, an animal that could trust, please, frustrate, infuriate, delight and - in the end - break your heart.</span></p>","price":7.589999999999999858,"stock":32,"created_at":"2024-08-05 17:42:52.883634","updated_at":"2024-08-05 17:42:52.883634","subcategory_id":5,"cover_image":"book_covers/police-dog.jpg","pages":256,"publication_date":"2010-07-05","about_author":"<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Gordon Thorburn</strong> is the legitimate child of Hrothgar Tørbjorn, Swedish air ace, whose Volvo night fighter was mistakenly shot down over Dewsbury. Hrothgar sold his parachute and married Ivy Milburn, a Geordie ice-cream girl and exotic-dance understudy, in a private ceremony at Leeds City Varieties.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">As a boy, Gordon was keen to be a bought ledger clerk with the Assembly of the Free Churches of Scotland but his father wanted him to be a poet or sculptor. As a compromise, Gordon enrolled at the Kirkstall Lane Temperance College to learn black-pudding knotting. He supplemented this with a course in participle dangling then ran away to London to be indentured to the advertising legend S H Benson, gent., as an infinitive splitter (hot metal).</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">After two years' trying to think of a different way of saying 'Guinness is good for you', Gordon joined McCann Erickson where he became known as 'The Nine out of Ten Copywriter'. Phrases he coined there included 'The Esso sign appertains to happy motoring', 'A Double Diamond works quite well considering', 'Oh, Bisto', ‘Hardly anything acts faster than Anadin’ and 'I'd like to buy the world a Jennings of Cockermouth'.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Gordon lived in Suffolk for fifteen years but became dismayed by a large number of Essex people moving in and erecting fibreglass Victorian street lamps in their gardens. After ten years in Appleby-in-Westmorland smallholding and good-lifing, he’s now back in Suffolk with his wife Sue, working on several new books.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">See also www.gordonthorburn.co.uk</p>","review":"<p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">What a joy of a book! Lots of very dry humour, action and hilarious stories. A great tribute to Cass who was a one off and as the book says: “born for the job he loved. “ I like the insights into Joes life as well and the obvious camaraderie between his police colleagues. Maybe set in the mid to late 80’s is hard to say? Some references v different to todays eg no more WPCs. Being told in the voice of a third person slightly wrong footed me at first. But after a while it didnt seem to matter. I guess with all the legal stuff with all names being changed etc this was easier. It remains a good story, a love story really. I hope “Joe” and his family are still alive and well. Thank you for sharing: and yes I did cry..</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">This book has taken me while to read, but only due to competing priorities. It has not been often that I have had the chance to continue reading this book, but have done at each opportunity. It could be funny, touching, and in the end heartbreaking, but if the reader is not a dog lover they will remain untouched by the author's tale. That being said, if the reader is not a dog lover, doubt they would be interested in this kind of book in the first place.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I am a dog lover and my favourite breed is the German Shepherd. Cassius is everything that a dog should be and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The training of Joe and Cassius was interesting and informative, but it is the sheer determination, loyalty and obedience of Cassius that shines through. Without a doubt the king of dogs. For a bit of light reading I would certainly recommend this book although at times it is a bit repetitive!.</span>'</p>"},

While I’m not a vegetarian, in the last few years I’ve been experimenting much more with vegetarian cooking as a way of saving money (when did meat become so expensive??) and eating more healthily. I also find many vegetarian recipes to be more ‘interesting’ with a wider range of ingredients and flavours than non-vegetarian meals. For that reason, I’d say I prefer this book to ‘Nosh for Students’ but perhaps that’s just me.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I have been absolutely delighted with this book and cook from it almost every week for my husband and me. I have also prepared a number of the recipes for friends and family, including the sweet potato tagine, the nutty crumble, the nut and courgette slice, several of the soups and a number of the risottos (a big shout out also for my favourite recipe in the book: khitcherie! A complete revelation! I've made it countless times, including for family, and it's so deliciously moreish that I have been known to polish off enough for about three people!) It has beautiful colour photos throughout and the instructions are clear and helpful.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I have also found the sauces section to be very useful (the peanut sauce works very well in stir-fries or satay) along with the suggestions for salad dressings and sandwich fillings.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">As other reviews have said, this is definitely not just a book for students but for anyone looking for quick, easy to prepare dishes for everyday cooking that don’t cost the earth.</span>'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Decent quality book. Useful ‘how to cook…”sections at the start, also store cupboard and equipment lists. Photos for every recipe. Easy for my daughter to understand step by step instructions and no weighing required. Great idea! QR codes for more content but I haven’t tried them out. Each recipe has a cost per person and an ease of cooking star rating. Some recipes are a bit basic though, for instance ‘fruity rice’ - I thought would actually be a recipe for home made rice pudding plus fruit. However, the recipe requires you to buy a tin of rice pudding add half a packet of frozen fruit +1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and that’s it. Perhaps a little too simplistic! Not sure where the author shops though as not convinced the shopping list cost totals at the back are strictly accurate. Overall I’m pleased with the purchase and I’m sure my daughter will get lots of ideas from it when she goes to uni.</span>'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Brilliant! I bought this for my daughter as a gift as she left for uni, thinking she wouldn't use it for a few years. She's using it every week and is loving the variety, the easy instructions and the brilliant meal planners. She's finding the portions large so in some cases is getting more than one meal out of every meal from the book. She's also saving a fortune having found the local market to buy her ingredients.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I honestly never expected her to get into cooking and do so much of it but this has inspired her. She's even made a few for us when we have visited and they've been absolutely delicious! We are about to buy ourselves a copy for home!</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Highly recommended in terms of healthy but very tasty food, brilliantly put together for students to keep life simple and cheap.

The Testament of Mariam marked something of a departure. Set in the first century, it recounts, from an unusual perspective, one of the most famous and yet ambiguous stories in human history. At the same time it explores life under a foreign occupying force, in lands still torn by conflict to this day. Her second historical novel, Flood, takes place in the fenlands of East Anglia during the seventeenth century, where the local people fought desperately to save their land from greedy and unscrupulous speculators. The second novel in the Fenland Series, Betrayal, continues the story of the search for legal redress and security for the embattled villagers. This Rough Ocean is a novel based on the real-life experiences of the Swinfen family during the 1640s, at the time of the English Civil War, when John Swynfen was imprisoned for opposing the killing of the king, and his wife Anne had to fight for the survival of her children and dependents. Currently the author is working on a late sixteenth century series, featuring a young Marrano physician who is recruited as a code-breaker and spy in Walsingham’s secret service. The first book in the series is The Secret World of Christoval Alvarez, the second is The Enterprise of England, the third is The Portuguese Affair, the fourth is Bartholomew Fair, the fifth is Suffer the Little Children and the sixth is Voyage to Muscovy. She now lives in Broughty Ferry, on the northeast coast of Scotland, with her husband, formerly vice-principal of the University of Dundee, and a rescue kitten. www.annswinfen.com</span></p>","review":"<p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I've read all of this wonderful series to date but I would rate 'Voyage to Muscovy' as the best yet. Maybe it's because it deals with a setting in Russian history with which I was only vaguely familiar but one which whetted my appetite to know more. This is a period of murderous political intrigue and terror overseen, on paper, by a weak Tsar (son of Ivan the Terrible) but, in fact, controlled by his ruthless brother-in-law. Godunov. The central character, Christoval Alvarez (Kit), travels across Muscovy during winter, sometimes by sleigh and this give the author a wonderful opportunity to blend descriptive detail with fascinating historical facts while keeping the fast-paced spy story rollicking along at an infectious pace. It is this ability to convey so comprehensively Kit's experiences in this inhospitable land which marks out the quality of the writing. Characters, even minor ones, are vividly depicted with an economy of style. Dialogue is a particularly strong contributor to characterisation - crisp and authentic-sounding. Overall, a compelling read, whether as a stand-alone or as part of the Christoval series. Strongly recommended.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The chronicles of Christoval is a beautiful series of books. They are well written and extremely well researched. Each book takes you on a different emotional journey and you can taste the fear, the horror and the love in each one. I have read them one after another and as soon as one was finished I couldn’t wait to start the next. Although each tells an individual event through to its conclusion I would recommend beginning at book 1 and working your way through.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I have so loved these books. This is the sixth in the series. I have now read them all and wish that Ms Swinfen would either give a definitive end or just carry on. Voyage to Muscovy brings the sharp contrast of rich and poor Russia into focus. If you like historical novels, based on good research, this series is a treat.</span>'</p>"},

Increasing poverty, vagrancy, and crime in a restless London compel a nervous Privy Council to close the playhouses, forcing Lord Strange’s Men to go on tour, while hostility to foreign refugees, aggravated by Marlowe’s play, The Jew of Malta, adds to the danger on the streets for Strangers like Kit Alvarez. Other dangers are more subtle. The ensnaring of young men by illegal loan sharks and the circulation of damning accusations, both public and private, increase the atmosphere of fear and distrust which permeates a city threatened by twin evils – death of the body from plague, death of the soul from heresy.

He scribes and illustrates books for sale, mainly to students in Oxford Uni...and then he finds a really talented new illustrator....</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Real people, going about their real lives...but in the 1350s. Hungry, tired, jealous, happy, worrying about the same things we worry about, all living in thatched wattle and daub houses lit by candles. His sister gets up before dawn to make bread for the household (Ye Gods!) and worries the state of his clothes, his kids run about in the garden with their puppy and he meets up with his friends and chats to them... It's lovely. Travel to the 14th century and enjoy.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A very nice series, very engaging.

Learn how to manage a 14th century deer hunt. Imagine the difficulties of arable farming using hand tools like scythes. And be allowed to uncover a nasty murder or two and see how spies operated. All this is packaged with believable dialogue, interesting, well drawn characters, and lovely descriptions of the farm and the fields around the manor.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I heard someone describe a book as a 'you are there' book once. If you want to feel what it might have been really like to live in the 14th century, then this for you. Meet Nicholas and his family returning to the family farm to help with the harvest. If you like lots of action and gunfire, you probably won't like it, but if you've ever enjoyed Cadfael books or Norah Lofts' or Diana Norman's, you may well like this. And there are two books before this and one after. Lots more to enjoy.</span>'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">This book begins in the summer of 1353, not long after the end of the last book. Nicholas Elyot asks his friend, Jourdain, and two of his students, plus Philip Olney of Merton College, with his woman and crippled son, to help with the harvest at his former home, the farm now held by his cousin, Edmond. The de Vere family from the Manor was wiped out in the Pestilence and there is a new lord at the Manor, one Master Mordon from London, who has made himself extremely unpopular in the neighbourhood.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A thoroughly unpleasant man, Mordon makes no attempt to fit into the life of a country lord. He is a merchant by trade, and from humble beginnings if his manners are anything to go by. When he is killed on a hunt in the Royal Forest, it is hard to believe it was an accident, and his widow wastes no time in having her servants seize a local man she insists is the murderer. Luckily, there are other county lords there and the local man is locked up, rather than hanged out of hand. The coroner and sheriff have been sent for and the real culprit must be found, especially as both officials are corrupt.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Although there is a murder, it is not graphic, and even though a certain amount of explanation is needed, it is written with a delicate touch. The story flows effortlessly through ordinary, everyday happenings and other, rather more dramatic occurrences. The conclusion, in both kinds of events is ….. unexpected.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">As always with Ann Swinfen’s historical novels, the period and customs have been meticulously researched, and a history lesson is woven into the fabric of the story. This always adds veracity to the author's stories and gives her books an added dimension. Reading an Ann Swinfen book is always a pleasure for me, well-written and edited. As I have said in other reviews, Ann Swinfen is a marvellous teller of tales and I can recommend her books to all lovers of historical novels.</span>'</p>"},

Nicholas Elyot is once again confronted with mysteries to solve, although at first the strange events at the nearby building site of Queen's College new chapel do not seem to serious. That soon changes though and together with the mysterious disappearance of his friend Jordain's youngest student, there is much to intrigue Nicholas. His personal life is also perplexing him although his sister Margaret seems to know more about his feelings than he does himself! Even Rowan the dog plays a small but vital role as things play out.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The great thing about all six of these books is the way that I feel I am getting to know the characters. Reading this book was like meeting up with old friends and picking up just where you left off the last time you saw them. This is something that the best writers do and it's something I really appreciate as a reader. It is a joy getting to know Nicholas and his family and friends, seeing relationships develop over time without haste. Don't read this book if you expect everything to be wrapped up in one go because it won't be!</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Ann must either be an expert in this period or has done a lot of research, most likely both.

I don't think I have ever been so engaged in a writer that I have gone straight in to the next book in the series. The writer paints a very vivid picture of Oxford as it was at the time of the plague, or Pestilence, as it was known then. The houses with cramped living conditions, the streets, the horse and carts, an altogether slower lifestyle. The intriguing storyline involves such amazingly described characters you feel as if you know them, and with the superb description of the town I was transported to walking and living in Oxford about 400 years ago.</span>'</p>"},

I'm so glad we found each other!</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The Devil and his motley crew breeze into 1930s Moscow and begin to reap havoc by reading people's minds, decapitating citizens and throwing an astonishing stage show that scandalises the local glitterati. To give you some inkling of what we're dealing with here, one of Satan's sidekicks is a talking cat the size of a pig, who is always in the thick of things (Bulgakov was evidently writing magical realism before Gabriel García Márquez was even born). The humour is riotous and the badinage so hilarious that I was holding my ribs, kicking my legs and Cossack dancing around the room!</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">In tandem with all of this magic and mayhem (please bear with me, dear reader) is a travel back in time to the trial and eventual crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. These subplot scenes are written in a completely different hist-fic style and are amazingly cinematic. The author's juxtaposition of the supernatural and the real is a constant stratagem throughout.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">It would take me all day to discuss the symbolism that underpins this incredible book, so I won't bore you with every detail. Suffice to say that Bulgakov sets out to satirise the Stalinist regime he was oppressed by (was Orwell's Animal Farm inspired by this novel?) and the Devil is on hand to mete out an extreme brand of either punishment or reward to whoever displeases or pleases him (human cowardice is what really gets his goat).</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The underlying parable jumps about all over the place – and sometimes out of windows on a broomstick! Heck, there is even a Magritte-style talking suit! I'd be lying if I said I'd grasped the significance of all of the author's philosophical analogies, but I certainly had a lot of fun trying.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I loved this book; really loved it. And it's incredible to think that The Master and Margarita was fashioned in the 1920s. It was years ahead of its time and is like no other novel I've ever read.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Clearly, this book wouldn't be for everyone, but if you like your literature dark, magical, intellectual, thought-provoking and absurd, then you should find room for it on your shelves.'</span></p>"},

However, this would count for nothing if all that worldbuilding had not been welded to a brilliant adventure story.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Every scene in the book is unforgettable, from the House of Elrond to the Mines of Moria. Each new incident or character adds something to the epic quest, and what characters they are. The touching loyalty between Sam and Frodo, the spiky rivalry between the elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli, the nobility of Aragorn and the pride of Boromir - all beautifully drawn.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">There are perhaps overindulgences - the deluge of names is daunting for first-time readers, Tom Bombadil and many of the songs seem slightly frivolous among the more serious adventures - but this is very much my personal taste, and stem largely from Tolkien's wish to share as much of his world with the reader as possible.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Middle-Earth lives and breathes, and is much a character as any hobbit or wizard. The land seems infused with both magic as well as an underlying melancholia, as that magic fades with the changing of the world.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">It seems inconceivable that any fan of fantasy or adventure has NOT read this grand work yet, but if you have not, grab this now. Enjoy the imagination, the thrills, and the magic; you'll not regret it.</span>'</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p>"},

The slipcase is nice to store them together, but the art doesn’t make it a necessity. I do have some gripes about the print quality where the print edges sometimes expand to the edges of the pages, so it creates a wave effect of enough thumb space to having to be careful not to smudge the print. But, it’s the basic mass market paperback set, so they’re all alike and the issue isn’t exclusive to this set.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Get it if you want the whole series.

Detective Lavender is an upright citizen, son of a policeman, well-educated (fluent Spanish and reading Candide in French), with exquisite manners, and a great deal of respect and affection for his investigative partner, Constable Woods, as well as a hankering for the happy family life enjoyed by the latter. While Lavender deals effortlessly with the upper echelons of Society, he has every respect and admiration for Woods' ability to make friends and confidants out of those lower down - even at the very bottom of - the social scale. They are a brilliant pairing, each with his own insecurities hidden beneath his professional armour.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The plot is particularly clever, with half-siblings, insanity, anticipated riches, distracting gypsies, and drunken dissolute estate owners. The writing includes the scenes, scents, social and historical events of the time without seeming forced. The characters are well-rounded, and it's impossible not to become involved with them as the story progresses. There's danger, pain and suffering, and the death of a character so well-portrayed that it's impossible not to feel anger at the waste; there's also the great satisfaction of seeing the guilty brought to boot, one way or another.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">It's a brilliant read, sucking the reader into the story, and I resented the time I had to spend away from the book. The denouement is particularly satisfying, and the recurring background hints of a romance for the solitary Lavender are intriguing. I've already bought all the others in the series, and can't wait to begin the next. Thank you very much, Karen Charlton, please keep writing!</span>'</p>"},

This mystery will remind you of the great international rivalries that were playing out at the time, whilst at the same time keeping you up to date with the compelling personalities and private lives/loves of the lovable Lavender and Ned Woods, and grounding you in the rather filthy/dangerous streets of early 19th Century London. Charlton maintains her strong female characters throughout, who are as present and crucial to the outcome as the main detectives. The descriptive work is as usual impeccable - if I had ever wondered what it was like to be forcibly kissed by a slimy Spanish aristocrat, then I now know.....'</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">'Having read the first instalment with Lavender and Woods of which I thoroughly enjoyed, I couldn't wait to read the next one! And what a enjoyable read. From Bow Street to Covent Garden and out to Wandsworth it was fascinating to read how London was back in the 1800s. A cleverly put together novel that keeps the reader guessing,. What starts out with a dead actress turns into deception, treachery and the state of the British Navy. I definitely would recommend reading it!'</span></p>"},

I love the characters, the history, the warmth and humour, the dialogue and plotting. It's the fifth book in the series, but the second one I have read, joining in the series halfway along them. I love the books. This one is even more enjoyable than the first one I read, Plague Pits and River Bones which I bought because I was intrigued by the title. Still think it's a great title. I am falling just a little bit in love with tall, handsome and athletic Lavender. And the repartee between him and Ned Woods as they gallop around such a well described London of that time is pure magic. This is how a book should be written setting, plot and characters all meshing seamlessly together to make entertaining reading. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I am normally rubbish at sticking with a book series. I read the first one maybe a second one, but the thought of five, six or more by the same writer with the same characters makes me hesitate and ponder all the other books, recommendations and pile of to be reads and I don't. I will make an exception in this case because the writing is so good and the entertainment level so huge. In my teens I loved the books of Georgette Heyer and the Lavender series ... I've only just learned he is based on a real Bow Street Principal Officer - is a delightful so now updated version, but better. Loved the book.'</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">'I love the historical nature of how the author writes.

In 2014, I purchased a second copy as she was much older and one evening she was talking about how much she loved that book and finding the tickle monster. So I purchased it as a surprise and to see a 14 year old light up at the sight of a Children’s pull tab book just filled me with love!!! The second book I purchased in 2014 was also the hardcover and contained all of the pull tabs. It should be noted that the “complete” book has a red liner running down the binding on the outside of the book. The board book does not have this red binding on it. I am actually here yet again, to purchase yet another copy of the hardcover book for my first grandchild. The baby isn’t on its way yet, but I want to ensure that the book will be here ready and waiting whenever he/she is designed to enter our lives. This book has brought my daughter and I priceless memories that I can attest to have lasted for 21 years and going. She still smiles whenever you mention The Tickle Book. Some memories are just priceless and this book helped us to make those memories. I can’t think of another book that could do what this one did for our bedtime ritual. I hope this will help clarify some of the differences in the other reviews.

She will bring those books over to us time and time again to read them and point out the different pictures to us. After having them for about 2 months she is already familiar with every item the book asked her to find as well as some other items on each page. I think that is what is so great about the I spy books because they can become new the more your child learns as you start to talk about more and more things on the page. Since I had not seen a picture of the pages when I purchased it I had different expectations of what it would be so hopefully these pictures will help you decide if it is right for your little one. I haven’t yet given the book to my daughter but based on other reviews I am hopeful that it will help her to learn her ABCs. Here’s what I think so far:</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">What I like most:</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- only 2 letters per page making it a great INTRO to the alphabet and not too challenging for younger toddlers</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- A couple items on every page corresponding with the letters so your child can learn more than just one word for each letter.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- The letters are large and take up most of the page making them easy to identify</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- Last page shows all of the letters together allowing you to challenge your child even further to identify the letters and maybe even remember a word that starts with that letter.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- A good sized book to bring in a diaper bag</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- There are no backgrounds that can be distracting and make it hard to find the items (not the case with all I Spy books)</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- Very inexpensive considering this book will likely be used for a long time</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">- It rhymes!!</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">After thinking hard about any possible drawbacks, the only thing that comes to mind is that all the letters are uppercase and I have been told that it is best to start with lowercase letters since that is what your child will see most when reading.</span>'</p>"},

The creativity of the puzzles is superb' --Escape the Review</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">'I love a good puzzle, and this is many many good puzzles wrapped up in a series of challenging escape rooms. Lots of visual puzzles, codes to work out, pieces to put together - with hints and solutions at the back if you get stuck. I'm about half way through it at the moment and the going is getting trickier - but there's such a sense of satisfaction when you work out individual elements and then see how they go together. The overall story that links all the rooms isn't too intrusive into the main point of discovering and solving clues, and ties it all together well. I would fully recommend this to any escape room afficionados and people who don't give up too easily.'</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">'I really wanted to love this book as I am a big fan of the physical and board game escape rooms. Each of the 10 chapters is full of clues and puzzles to solve in order to progress the story and move onto the next chapter. However, despite some good elements in the book, there are various issues such as typos and errors that can leave you unable to solve the puzzles without resorting to the solutions page.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Pros: The book looks nice, with good quality paper and illustrations. The coherent storyline made me want to progress so I could find out what happens next and I found that some puzzles or whole chapters worked really well together and were a lot of fun to solve. It’s also a really good price, given the amount of puzzles it contains.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Cons: As mentioned above, there are some misprints and errors. For example, in chapter 1 the character supposedly finds a 5x5 grid but the page actually shows a 5x6 grid. This created some confusion about whether or not this was a deliberate clue that we were supposed to notice. However, it was just a mistake. Another misprint guides you to the wrong answer for part of a puzzle. These small errors early in the book impacted the overall enjoyment as you can never quite be sure whether you have accurate information or not.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The book does promise a challenge although sometimes this amounts to you having to commit to a lot of time-consuming work in order to solve a puzzle. Each section contains a lot of text with different clues and puzzle pieces. The result is that more time is spent working out which clues go together than actually solving the puzzles. There are hints available, but I mostly found that either I already knew the information or that the hints were too obscure to be helpful.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I was also confused by the fact that after completing a section, the book will sometimes reveal the code/ answer you have been working on and sometimes it won’t. This leaves you having to check the solutions page just to work out whether you reached the correct answer not.</span><br><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Overall, it’s an interesting attempt although the errors and inconsistencies can be particularly frustrating, especially when they stop you being able to solve the puzzles. I think it would have been improved by paying more attention to the details of the puzzles and sometimes by giving more obvious connections between clues. However, I’ve enjoyed it enough to persevere, hence the rating of 3 stars.'</span></p>"},

I contacted the author but he said they are not planning to publish the rest again, so I had to buy them used on Amazon and Ebay. They are such wonderful books that it was worth it!! The author is also extremely friendly in writing the emails!</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">This is the way to get kids interested in math and love it!!! I hope every child can be inspired by math with these books! Yes some topics are advanced for my daughter, but there was so much fun in it that it didn't matter to her. She would get so absorbed in the reading and rereading. She doesn't go in order, she just grabs one and starts randomly. I think in a few years when she is learning the more advanced math, she will have some foundation from these books and in turn, enjoy these books even more!</span>'</p>"},

First of all non fiction is a great way to get reluctant readers into books and the grosser it is the better for that. I have found that using these or excerpts from these is a good way to get some of the pupils at older ages groups but who are below average readers interested. They are not an easy read for younger and struggling children but interest is what we are after here. These are very like the horrible history series except without the option of watching the TV instead.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Personally I bought a set for my son (6 years old) because of his ongoing fascination with science. Reading them is a little beyond him but only because the nature of the subject means the occasional convoluted latin or medical phrase has to get used so he was quite happy reading about different sorts of plants and animals but gets thrown by dropping in terms like \"eukaryote\". So it's probably aimed at the 8 year and upward age groups and now I use it by reading and editing on the fly and picking the right book to go with whatever we've been doing recently. So if he's shoved a splinter into his finger we'll have blood, bones and body bits, if we've been staring a bits of plant then tonight's bedtime reading is vicious veg.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">In short this wins on all fronts. You can tie them in with other activities, older or better readers can read them independently and reluctant readers can be interested.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">My two boys absolutely love this set. My 6 year old has been a reluctant reader - but now he comes home from school, grabs a Horrible Science book and happily reads for an hour or two. My almost 8 year old also loves them. The only trouble is when they read out some facts from the book about how people tried to cure/avoid the black death for example. Now I have reached 40, these gruesome facts make me shudder, but I know for sure that I would have loved them when I was young. There is a slightly smaller box of Horrible Geography books which are also great - and I've just bought the Horrible History box of books. Great value, great content.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The only minor gripe I might make is that the books are packed quite tight in the box (could have done with being 0.5cm wider) and you have to lift the books up to see what each one is which a shorter base and bigger lid would have solved.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A very good stand-alone purchase but complements the other 'Horrible' series of books very well (Horrible Histories, Horrible Geography, Murderous Maths, et al.). Plenty of carefully chosen stories and collection of facts all presented in the classic 'Horrible' genre. The books are obviously well written and have a positive impact on learning. For example, my 8 yo daughter was able to explain to me how an electric guitar works with respect to the amplification of electric signals generated by the disturbance of the magnetic fields around the pickups - this was in response to her pointing at the pickups and asking what they were, I simply said they were magnets, she then worked out for herself how the generation of sound could be achieved. I asked how she knew this and she said the principles were described in the 'Shocking Electricity' book.</span>'</p>"},

Really glad I purchased it.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I’m about halfway through reading this book and it’s been great. It explains the different types of plants used, the different processes used to make the different tea types, and the popular tea blends, before looking at the growing regions around the world and tea culture and traditions in those places.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Some parts are a little breath maybe, but it is a very good introduction to the wider variety available and has made me curious far beyond the black tea blends I was curious about originally. Who knows, I might even end up trying some of the recipes at the back of the book.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Book time! I have been voraciously reading, it is the time of year where I go deep into the books and tend not to come out again until spring. Today's book is The Tea Book by Linda Gaylard and by one of my favorite publishers, DK. See, DK has a tendency to publish really pretty books, their book on Gemstones is still a classic favorite, but this is about tea and not rocks. From the moment I cracked open the book I was impressed with the visuals, it is beautiful!</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">But looks alone do not make a book (unless it was a photo book, of course) so how is the substance? First off I will say, I think I found THE perfect book for people new to tea and with a voracious appetite for knowledge. This covers so many of the basics, but instead of stopping there it delves deep into various cultures, history, and regions. I was pleased to see coverage on Korean tea and their tea culture, along with Vietnam and Kenya, and not just the typical China, Japan, India, and Sri Lanka.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">There is a large section on recipes, but it is not the more trendy cooking with teas but different drinks using tea. Frankly most of them look so delicious, I plan on breaking a few of them out for events when I have to serve tea to a bunch of people. So many delicious looking recipes, plus a method for making popping spheres meaning an upgrade to bubble teas.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Along with lots of juicy information about tea and recipes, there is a section on herbal teas/tisanes. I had mixed feelings on this, on the one hand it was very valuable information (the wheel of healing was my favorite) and herbal teas are definitely a big part of the tea world, but on the other hand this is space that could have been filled with more info about tea!</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">At times I wish this book would have delved deeper into various topics, mostly because I really enjoy Linda's writing style (I have been following her blog for a while, good reading there!) and would have loved to have seen more of it combined with DK's signature bombastic visuals. I find myself daydreaming about a book of this style devoted entirely to Yunnan's tea culture or Vietnamese tea. Again, I really cannot stress how I think everyone interested in tea should buy this book, even though a lot of the information presented was a refresher for me, I loved reading it because it is so well written and enjoyable.</span>'</p>"},

I've collected anything I can find on the subject, so have read a number of books to become better informed about what 'booch' offers. I heard about this book when it first came out and thought I wouldn't need anything it could add. Then I read some reviews from others and thought I'd look for myself. How pleased I am that I got a copy! Yes, it covers much that I already knew, but adds a huge amount of info from someone who is clearly seriously enthusiastic about her subject, and knowledgeable to boot! Hannah Crum already has a great website offering help both to novices (where we all start) and more experienced brewers alike. This is one for those who like to sit at the kitchen table and read from a book rather than a screen (I think there are lots of us still around), who want to learn and be entertained - she's a great ambassador for her passion and writes engagingly all around the subject of this weird little 'fungus' that inspires such loyalty! I have yet to try some of her suggestions for cocktails with it, nor have I made anything to carry out of dried scoby - but I love the idea!

It's a treasure-trove of information about the brewing of kombucha (the fermented tea drink) and has a wealth of suggestions as to how to flavour this refreshing beverage. I went straight to the chapter \"Flavour Inspirations\" as I am enjoying discovering just how many different ways there are of flavouring kombucha. I've tried strawberry alone and with other berry fruits, also apple and cinnamon and am now experimenting with apricot and vanilla pod and also with freshly picked elderflowers added to the first fermentation (there might be downsides to this so I have started a separate brewing jar). It all smells wonderful. There is also historical information about kombucha in Chapter 5 which is a fascinating read. I can heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in brewing kombucha - it really is the \"one go-to resource for all things kombucha\".</span>'</p>"},

Brought back memories of foraging with my grandfather. I have forgotten much of what I learned as a child, simply because I stopped doing it. This book reminded me. I can now enjoy foraging again with my own grand child. It's small, yes, but no less useful.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Fits nicely into a pocket to take out on walks. I've just purchases another copy as a gift.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I recently borrowed an earlier version of this book (Harper Collins Natural History 1989) from a friend and was so impressed I wanted one of my own (and in fact one for a friend too, who was also impressed by the book). The newer version is more compact.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Compared to the earlier version, there is now an index for the recipes, and new recipes have been added. This is quite useful. Unfortunately a few plants have been all but left out, I'm not sure if this is because some of these plants are now endangered or have disappeared altogether. E.g. there was no reference to the marsh mallow - I plant I find particularly intriguing! A more serious omission in my view is the poisonous plants: there is a whole group of plants (e.g. cow parsley, wild parsnip) which to me look almost identical, in the field, to the dropworts and hemlock - very poisonous; the new version does mention some of these in passing (but not in the index) and suggests using a well illustrated field guide in combination with this Gem. I think I found it more practical to have clear descriptions, with clear warnings, in the one book, as in the earlier version.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">However, the layout of the new guide, in spite of its tiny size, is beautifully clear and it contains photographs, which is a big improvement. Its size (approx. 12*8*1 cm) means it fits easily in any of my pockets. I can hardly wait for next spring to gather beech leaves and try the beech leaf noyau, a `thickish, sweet spirit ...devastating in its effects' ... !</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">If you have any interest in foraging, this little portable book is ideal. It is small enough to fit in your back pocket, very portable little thing. The plants in the book have illustrations and photos so it’s pretty easy to recognise what you’re looking at, even for a novice like me. It goes in to a bit of detail on how you would prep and use the plants you’re able to forage, which is really useful too. There’s so many uses for this book - parents out with their kids teaching them a little about nature - all kids love this sort of thing they really do, keep it with you when camping to see what you can add to the campfire, keep it handy when on a hike so you can pick up some snacks along the way, it’s even a great addition for survivalists to learn how to live off the land. Great little book, very useful when there’s no phone coverage, and very cheap too. What’s not to like?</span>'</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"},

Later, his family moved to rural southern Wisconsin, and then to Madison. Sam's first presentation on edible wild plants was to his seventh grade science class, demonstrating the foods that he collected regularly on his three-mile walk to school. He began \"survival camping\" at fourteen and led his first wild food walks when he was 19. After graduating from high school, he moved near the south shore of Lake Superior and built a rustic log cabin on an abandoned farmstead, chasing his childhood dream of \"living off the land\" while working part-time at a variety of jobs.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Since 2000, when he won the Hazel Wood National Wild Foods Cooking Contest, Sam has been teaching regularly on edible wild plants, giving workshops across the United States. In 2002 he was inducted into the National Wild Foods Hall of Fame at North Bend State Park in West Virginia. His first book, The Forager's Harvest, has won a Midwest Book Award, IPPY Book Award, and was a finalist for the USA Book News Best Books 2007 award. It has been a steady Amazon category best-seller and has sold more than 250,000 copies. His second book, Nature's Garden, has received similar acclaim and sold over 100,000 copies. Incredible Wild Edibles was released November 1, 2017. His newest book: \"Sam Thayer's Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants of Eastern and Central North America,\" was published in 2023 and is a winner of the National Outdoor Book Award in the nature category.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">He currently lives in the woods of northwestern Wisconsin with his wife, Melissa, their daughters, Myrica and Rebekah and son, Joshua. Along with speaking and writing, he is also a maple syrup producer, wild rice harvester, owns a small organic orchard, and has been revitalizing a lost tradition of making hickory nut oil.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Besides wild food foraging, Sam is an all-around naturalist with particular interest in reptiles, amphibians, bird watching, botany, and mammals. His passion for wild food extends to studying the origin of cultivated plants and the socio-economic history of the human diet.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">For more information, visit his website: Forager's Harvest</p>","review":"<p><strong><u>Reviews left by the UK foragers:</u></strong></p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Brilliant day out book, I have become accustomed to the odd snack as I walk along so this is an adventure waiting to happen.

When I first got the book and started flicking through it, it was obvious that a lot of effort and research had gone into it. Page after page of information on all the different plants, good descriptions, any potential hazards, similar species and ways to use them, it's all there. I saw some people saying they weren't too impressed by the black and white images but to be honest the photos are of such good quality (the vast majority of them anyway) that if you were to bring a bit of the plant in question indoors and hold it in front of the page, I have no doubt you would be able to make a positive identification, especially with the descriptions to help. All it takes is a bit of attention to detail, which let's be honest if you are foraging, you are meant to have anyway ;)</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The book is divided up in to all the families of plants making it easy to navigate, here and there the author has included a few poisonous plants as learning about these is half the battle when it comes to not poisoning yourself and the way it is written feels like how somebody would talk, as though you have someone there mentoring you which I thought was nice.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">In summary, a dozen or fewer average quality photos (take into account there must be a few hundred in the book) is all I can really pick out to fault. The whole book is really quality and I think if you are planning on foraging seriously, you won't be disappointed with it. £20 well spent! :)'</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"},

I think there's always going to be a problem for wild mushroom hunters in that one will always be slightly uncertain that the mushrooms they have found match any in the guide, however as long as you are giving it serious consideration I reckon all will be well.

It restricts itself to 60-some readily identifiable edible species and a smaller number of the unpleasant-to-deadly fungi that must be avoided. Of particular value to the beginning fungi forager is the fact that the description of each edible species identifies any similar-looking poisonous fungi that might be gathered by mistake and gives a cross-reference to the book's detailed description of the poisonous species.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">While the author makes clear the inherent risks of eating wild fungi and recommends cross-checking in multiple sources, the book is sufficiently clear and comprehensive within its range to give you the confidence to pick and eat your first foraged mushroom. Additionally, the text makes clear that some of the species are very easy to identify, while others take more experience to be sure of. Our four first-year mushrooms were all in that easy to identify category. But now, with a year's worth of puzzling over the various attributes of many fungi, we feel ready to branch out into the next category of the not-quite-so-easy-to identify.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">And, of course, as other reviews have pointed out, this book is wonderfully written - full of wit and humour as well as sound advice. I have re-read most of it several times. and each time I learn a little more and still chuckle at some of the humour.'</span></p>"},

In this authoritative, witty book John Wright takes us on a trip to the seaside. But before introducing us to the various species to be harvested, he touches on such practicalities as conservation and the ethics of foraging; safety from tides, rocks and food poisoning; the law and access to the shore, our right to fish, landing sizes and seasons; and equipment such as nets, pots and hooks. Next comes the nitty-gritty: all the main British seashore species that one might be tempted to eat. The conservation status, taste and texture, availability, seasonality, habitat, collecting technique and biology of each species is covered; there are also quite a few gratuitous but fascinating diversions. The species covered include crustacea (brown shrimp, common crab, lobster, prawn, shore crab, spider crab, squat lobster, velvet swimming crab); molluscs (clams, cockle, dog whelk, limpet, mussel, oyster, razor clam, winkle); mushrooms; plants (alexanders, babbington's orache, fennel, frosted orache, marsh samphire, perennial wall rocket, rock samphire, sea beet, sea buckthorn, sea holly, sea kale, sea purslane, sea rocket, spear-leaved orache, wild cabbage, wild thyme); and seaweed (carragheen, dulse, gut weed, laver, pepper dulse, sea lettuce, sugar kelp, kelp).

But there is plenty of variety from food to natural remedies to drinks to skin care. So, I think most people who have any interest in what they are seeing on the land, will find something useful here.

It is often recommended as one of the best mushroom identification guides available.</p><p><strong>Educational Value</strong>: The book is highly valued for its educational content, providing readers with the knowledge and tools needed to identify mushrooms safely and accurately. It is used by both beginners and experienced mycologists.</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Phillips' book is compact, beautiful, well-organised, and somewhat too large and heavy to take into the field.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Phillips has studied fungi for 30 years, as well as producing excellent guides to other areas of natural history, such as grasses, trees, herbs, and wild food. There can be no doubt, though, that fungi are more of a challenge, and his skill and experience are visible in this book.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">One choice is immediately obvious: most of the colour plates are wonderful photographs - almost as clear as traditional field-guide paintings - with fresh specimens young and mature, whole and sectioned, cap and stem, carefully arranged on coloured paper. This is an interesting and intelligent choice, a deliberate compromise between the analytic clarity of paintings and the desire to show the inevitable colour variation and imperfection of real specimens - while stopping short of trying to show the environment of every species. Actually, Phillips sometimes also includes an image taken in the wild, or else includes a fern-frond, pine-cone or sprig of moss to show where you may find the species.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The page design is clean and inviting; the text is quite small but legible, and the style quite discursive for a guidebook. However, the descriptions are detailed and systematic.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Attributes listed are cap, stem, flesh, gills, spores, habitat, and edibility, on which last Phillips is very detailed. Dimensions are indicated by saying the illustration is 40% life size, etc, which is not quite as handy as giving an actual size but good enough.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">I found this an excellent book for actual identification. If you are going to take photographs to help in identifying your finds, you could do well to copy Phillips' style here and arrange specimens on card with sections, caps etc, with perhaps a small coin or ruler for scale. Then when you want to know whether the gills are free or adnate, you will be able to find out.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Phillips and his publisher have made a really serious effort to make identifying fungi easier and more fun. They have found English names for the groups - Coral Fungi, Jelly Fungi, Morels, Finger &amp; Disc Fungi, and so on. Admittedly the largest group of Basidiomycetes is simply \"Mushrooms with Gills\", and this occupies 250 pages of the book (out of 382). So there is no real alternative to Latin names for the genera.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">But Phillips has another trick up his sleeve here: a wonderful Visual Index over 3 pages to the 35 main genera - the richly coloured Russula, the shiny Hygrocybe (Waxcaps), the fragile Mycena (Bonnets) and so on. Each index entry has a fine thumbnail photograph and a matching square of about 50 words summarising the nature of the genus. It is ingenious, beautiful, and genuinely helpful - I think you will find you get to the right genus in under a minute for many specimens.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The glossary, by contrast, is a bit heavy and traditional - why ever did he choose to say Infundibuliform when Funnel-shaped would have done better? And it is not illustrated.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">If this book fitted into a pocket, it would be almost perfect. As it is, it is a delight in the study - or in the kitchen for after a mushroom-hunt: Phillips offers careful advice on choosing safe and edible mushrooms. If you are looking for just one mushroom book, this is an excellent choice, unless you want a field-guide.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Like many people, the original edition of this book was my first field ID book on fungi. Being so familiar with it's structure, it is really easy for me to locate something I've found in Roger Phillips' book. The simple key at the beginning usually gets you straight to the right section of the book to identify your mushroom. Happily for me, the structure of the original is preserved in this new edition.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">As I have progressed with my mycophilia over the years I have acquired most of the readily available field guides on the market. This is the inevitable curse of the mushroom hunter. There are always a number of species covered in each new guide that do not appear in the others. I am always seeking the one perfect field guide. The truth is, you often need to check a particular specimen in several, but I always come back to the Phillips.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">The key to this book's success must be the consistently high quality of the photographs. He is a fantastic photographer and despite (or perhaps because of)his insistence on removing the specimens to a studio, these images capture accurately the essential details of each species. Compare the perhaps more erudite Encyclopedia by M.

This edition is a beautiful art work, an excellent buy as long as you have the right readership in mind. Here is the original text, no watered down 'abridged' version but a tale that would be a PG at the cinema, with baddies biting the dust and in some cases the ocean and, sadly, some goodies perishing too. It's an action-packed adventure for boys and tomboys aged ten to ninety, although some girls may dislike the fact that the only women are the feeble Mrs Hawkins and Mrs Silver, notable by her absence. The fact is that the novel reflects the realities of 18th C treasure-hunting when, unless a woman WAS a pirate like Anne Bonney, she was unlikely to be found at sea, sailors having the superstition that a woman on board brought bad luck in the form of storms and high winds.</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">Stevenson's style is graphic and fast-paced and, although his vocabulary may daunt younger independent readers, all eager adventure-lovers with the patience to consult a dictionary if challenged, and the humility to take on an accurately researched sea-story of the days of sail, will find it gripping. It's best read aloud, remembering that Silver is an educated and utterly unprincipled villain, a 'killing gentleman' as Sir Terry Pratchett would term him. There's nothing funny about him. Captain Smollett is a braver man than you may recall, worthy of our respect, Dr Livsey is a decent man and a patient friend, and Squire Trelawney a brave, generous, gormless clot... As for Ben Gunn, Israel Hands, Blind Pugh and Billy Bones... Open the book and meet Kidd's crew. Pieces of Eight!</span><br><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">It was bought as a gift for a Dad to read to his son and to keep as a family treasure but is also suitable for reading by torch-light under the duvet: warning, it's a weighty tome that may become a strain for small hands.</span>'</p><p>'<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(15,17,17);\">A classic novel that I've just re-read after more than half a century. In my seventies the story has taken on a whole new side BUT you have to read it more slowly to appreciate the prose. Beautiful descriptions and wonderful vernacular \"pirates\" language it gripped me from first to last</span>'</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}]
