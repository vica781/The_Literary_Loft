The Literary Loft is an e-commerce platform designed for book lovers to explore and purchase a curated selection of books. This platform aims to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience that allows users to browse, search, and buy books seamlessly. The Literary Loft is designed to serve both casual readers and avid book collectors by offering a variety of genres and popular titles.

This project was created as part of my final project with Code Institute and is intended for educational purposes only.

## Project Purpose and Objectives

The primary goal of The Literary Loft is to simulate a real-world e-commerce application where users can:

- Browse a catalog of books with details and descriptions.
- Search and filter books by title, author, genre, or category.
- Add books to a shopping cart and complete a secure checkout.
- Purchase books either as a guest or as a registered user. While guest users can make purchases, they are encouraged throughout the process to sign in or register, as only registered users can experience the full benefits of the platform, including:
  - Access to order history for easy reference and reorders.
  - The ability to mark books as favorites for quick access.
  - The option to manage their personal account details and saved preferences.
- Subscribe to a newsletter to stay updated with the latest additions and promotions on The Literary Loft.

The project also aims to give site administrators full control over the inventory, enabling them to add, update, or remove books from the catalog without the need for a separate admin panel.
